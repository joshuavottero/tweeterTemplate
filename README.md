# Tweeter Project

instructions for the assignment came with the readme

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone that uses jQuery, HTML5 and plain ol' CSS3 to help web bootcamp students get comfortable with their front-end chops with those technologies.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

# Note from student

notes for any employers so they know what I did for sure

[this project was started with code provieded by the boot camp at] (https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/tweeter)

this project was intended to improve our front ends skills with HTML, CSS, flexbox jquery, ajax and a bit of responsive design 

work in public (scripts styles and index.html)are mostly my work. (disclaimer some lines at the top of index.html may not writen by me compare with link above if you want to make sure)

hope this clears up at least some misconceptions
